Normally, a setup program would take care of this, but since this is a github
project now, I rudimentaryly explain how to have TouchpadPeace start automatically
when you log in.

Open your registry editor (regedt32.exe or regedit.exe) and create a new string value in key

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run

Name:  TouchpadPeace
Type:  REG_SZ
Value: c:\folder\whereverTouchPadPeace\Lives\In\Your\Machine\TouchpadPeace.exe


The Value string should be the full path of the touchpad peace exe file.

There are multiple ways to start a program automatically after you log in to your account.   This is just one of them.
You can use any other way you like to auto-start TouchpadPeace.

Other possible key values may be
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Enjoy!
